# Synthesizing neighborhood-level AV preferences
Developed a machine-learning based microsimulation approach to understand the spatial distribution of public opinion towards privately-owned automated vehicles and shared automated vehicles. The scripts can found in the 'Script' folder; the trained machien learning models can be found in the 'Model' folder; and synthesized results for three cities can be found in the 'SynthesizingResults' folder.

The approach is three-folded. 

## (1) Machine Learning Classifier for AV opinions
Machine learning classifier is developed using the national public opinion survey conducted by [Dr. Robert Noland](https://bloustein.rutgers.edu/noland/) and Sicheng Wang at Rutgers University and [Dr. Andrew Mondschein](https://www.arch.virginia.edu/people/andrew-mondschein) and Zhiqiu Jiang at University of Virginia in 2017. To make the model transferrable to [2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS)](https://nhts.ornl.gov/), only variables that are shared by both surveys are used in the model training process. Common variables are selected, cleaned, and recoded using python notebook 'Script/common_variables_recoding' in the repository. The common variables and corresponding coding are as follows:

1. gender (male, female, other, prefer not to say)
2. hispanic (yes, no, prefer not to say)
3. race (white, african american, asian, other, prefer not to say)
4. age (Under 25 years old, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years, 85 or years older)
5. generation (Baby Boomers (age 55-74); Generation X (age 35-54); Millennials (age <=34); The Silent Generation (age above 75))
6. vehicle ownership (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6+)
7. number of kid (0, 1, 2, 3, 4+)
8. income (Under $25,000, $25,000 to under $50,000, $50,000 to under $100,000, $100,000 or greater, prefer not to say)
9. ridesharing frequency (A few teims per year, Once per month, Once per week, Several times per week, Never)
10. education (Four-year college degree, Two-year collge degree, Some College, Graduate or professional degree, High school or GED, Less than high school, Master's degree, Prefer not to say, Two-year collge degree, Other)
11. commute mode (Biking & Wlaking, Not Applicable, Other method, Personal Automobiles, Public Transit, Taxi, Uber, or Lyft)

Machine learning models are developed separately for interests in 

1. purchasing Automated Vehicles (binary);
2. sharing Automated Vehicles (i.e., using Taxi, Uber, Lyft, etc., but without drivers) (binary). 

The following machine learning models are trained and tuned in this study, using 10 fold cross validation method. Python package [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is used.  

* sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier
* sklearn.tree.ExtraTreeClassifier
* sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier
* sklearn.svm.LinearSV
* sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression
* sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier
* sklearn.neighbors.NearestCentroid
* sklearn.neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier
* sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier
* sklearn.linear_model.RidgeClassifier
* sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier

The trained models are saved as pickle files and are saved under 'Model' folder.

## (2) NHTS data AV preferences Imputation
The finalized machine learning models are then applied to NHTS dataset (after cleaning and recoding the common variables to match that used in the machine learning models) to impute the preferences for PAVs and SAVs for each individual in the NHTS data. In the Script folder, there are two scripts 'Apply_PAV_MODEL_TO_NHTS.py' and 'Apply_PAV_MODEL_TO_NHTS.py' that imputes PAV and SAV preferences to NHTS data. The scripts are developed and tested under Python 2.7 environment. The trained mdoels are saved under the The following pakcages are needed:
* Pandas
* Sklearn
  
## (3) Understanding the spatial distribution of Public Opinions
We then use the NHTS data as the seed matrix and census tract level household and personal varialbes as the marginal controls to synthesize households and population in several selected cities to understand the spatial distribution of the opinions at the census tract level. This process is implemented using PopGen1.1, an open source population synthesizer developed by [Dr. Ram Pendyala and his research team](https://www.mobilityanalytics.org/popgen.html) at Arizona State University. Note, it is also possible to synthesize to census blockgroup and/or census block level. However, it will take longer time for the mdoel to converge, when the spaital resolution is more refined. In this project, we synthesized neighborhood-level AV preferences for three cities, namely San Francisco, CA, Austin, TX, and Atlanta, GA at the census tract level. The results (in .csv format) can be found in the folder "Synthesize Results/CITY_NAME". Under each city subfolder five files can be found: 

1. PAV_SAV_SYNTHEESIZE_CITY_NAME.csv contains aggregated Census Tract level synthesized SAV and PAV adopters.
2. person_synthetic_data.csv contains disaggregated synthesized persons, with PAV and SAV preferences (this file can be used to create agents for simulation models)
3. person_synthetic_data_meta.txt contains beta data for the columns in the person_synthetic_data.csv file.
4. housing_synthetic_data.csv contains disaggregated synthesized households that synthesized persons belong to. 
5. housing_synthetic_data_meta. txt contains beta data for the columns in the housing_synthetic_data.csv file.
